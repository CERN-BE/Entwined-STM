Entwined-STM  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CERN-BE/Entwined-STM.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CERN-BE/Entwined-STM)
============

Entwined is a Software Transactional Memory implementing collections with semantic concurrency control. Library provides ACI (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation) guarantees with closed nested transactions.

The following collections have been implemented so far:

-  `TransactionalMap` - interface similar to `java.util.Map` but with fewer functions
-  `TransactionalMultimap` - similar to Guava `Multimap`
-  `TransactionalQueue` - implements `java.util.Queue` interface
-  `TransactionalRef` - holds a single value.
-  `GlobalReference` - a special case of `TransactionalRef` that can be used as a field in any class.

Library is very mature and is at the core of [OASIS](http://project-oasis.web.cern.ch/project-oasis/) which is a mission critical system at CERN.

Examples
-------------
You can find examples in [src/test/java/cern/entwined/demo](src/test/java/cern/entwined/demo). Here I list some of them.
- [SingleMapDemo](src/test/java/cern/entwined/demo/SingleMapDemo.java) quickly demonstrates how to use signle TransactionalMap.
- [IsolationDemo](src/test/java/cern/entwined/demo/IsolationDemo.java) demonstrates that local changes in a transaction are not visible to concurrent transactions.
- [RollbackDemo](src/test/java/cern/entwined/demo/RollbackDemo.java) shows that if transaction is terminated by an exception any local changes are discarded.


Installation
--------------

I'm planning to publish it on Maven central, but for now you can build it from the sources.

```
git clone git://github.com/CERN-BE/Entwined-STM.git
cd Entwined-STM
mvn jar:jar
ls -l target
```
