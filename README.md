Entwined-STM  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CERN-BE/Entwined-STM.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CERN-BE/Entwined-STM)
============

Entwined is a Software Transactional Memory implementing collections with semantic concurrency control. Library provides ACI (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation) guarantees with closed nested transactions.

The following collections have been implemented so far:

-  `TransactionalMap` - interface similar to `java.util.Map` but with fewer functions
-  `TransactionalMultimap` - similar to Guava `Multimap`
-  `TransactionalQueue` - implements `java.util.Queue` interface
-  `TransactionalRef` - holds a single value.
-  `GlobalReference` - a special case of `TransactionalRef` that can be used as a field in any class.

Library is very mature and is at the core of [OASIS](http://project-oasis.web.cern.ch/project-oasis/) which is a mission critical system at CERN.

Overview
-------------

Entry point to the library is the [Memory](src/main/java/cern/entwined/Memory.java) class. To construct it client has to provide an instance of the [SemiPersistent](src/main/java/cern/entwined/SemiPersistent.java) abstract class. All the transactional collections listed above extend this class.

The client can define her own transactional data type by directly extending SemiPersistent class or by using [CompositeCollection](src/main/java/cern/entwined/CompositeCollection.java). [TestSnapshot](src/test/java/cern/entwined/TestSnapshot.java) is a good example of a custom implementation.

To access the memory client has to run transaction:

```java
Memory<TransactionalMap<Integer, Integer>> memory = new Memory<TransactionalMap<Integer, Integer>>(
                new TransactionalMap<Integer, Integer>());
memory.runTransaction(new Transaction<TransactionalMap<Integer, Integer>>() {
    @Override
    public boolean run(TransactionalMap<Integer, Integer> data) throws Exception {
        //Operate on data here.

        return true; //true to commit, false to rollback
    }

    @Override
    public void committed(TransactionalMap<Integer, Integer> data) throws Exception {
        //Called when transaction has been committed. Commit callbacks are globally ordered
        //and are called in the commit order.

        //Read data here, any changes will be discarded.
    }
}
```

During commit memory may detect conflicts due to concurrent changes. In such a case `Memory` class will restart the transaction by discarding all the modifications done in the `run` method and by calling it again with the fresh snapshot of the data. Because of this it is crucial to never perform output in the `run` method, any output operation should be reserved for the `committed` block.

Examples
-------------
You can find examples in [src/test/java/cern/entwined/demo](src/test/java/cern/entwined/demo). Here I list some of them.
- [SingleMapDemo](src/test/java/cern/entwined/demo/SingleMapDemo.java) quickly demonstrates how to use signle TransactionalMap.
- [IsolationDemo](src/test/java/cern/entwined/demo/IsolationDemo.java) demonstrates that local changes in a transaction are not visible to concurrent transactions.
- [RollbackDemo](src/test/java/cern/entwined/demo/RollbackDemo.java) shows that if transaction is terminated by an exception any local changes are discarded.
- [Clojure examples](src/test/java/cern/entwined/demo/clojure_examples.clj) makes use of Clojure facade. Shows how to crate a custom snapshot and access it.
